## Project Name :  An app to suggest something to watch (Random!) :

#### Overview: An app suggests something to watch by taking from the user what kind of a series and movies enjoy to watch, and the app will show what the perfect match for their type is since it's hard to decide what you want to watch sometimes. There are two primary users the admin and the end-user. 

#### As a end-user I should be able to do the following :
- Browse the categories. 
- View the shows info (summary, type, number of episodes , rating.)
- Get recommendations based on thier types of shows .
- Add shows to thier fav list .
- list thier fav shows list. 
  



#### Usage :
 Explain to the user how to use your project . 
 for example:
 - type in search product_name to search for a product.
 - type in list_products to show all the products in the grocery.
 - type in show product_name to get information about this product.
 - type in buy product_name to buy the product . 
 - and so on...
